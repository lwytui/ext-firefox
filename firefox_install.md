# installation

**important notice: if you want to sideload the xpi, you should first go to `about:config` and set `xpinstall.signatures.required` to false and install firefox nightly or dev edition. otherwise, it will say it is broken.**

i submitted it to mozilla add-ons:  
https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/addon/lwytui-redirect-helper/

or you can download the .xpi file directly.
